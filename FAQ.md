### What is this website for?
>It shows Utopian.io contributions that are waiting to be reviewed and contributions waiting to be upvoted.

### Why are posts waiting to be reviewed?
>Our moderators need time to review your contribution and determine the quality of your contribution. The eventual score given to your contribution, alongside your contribution's category, determines the weight of the upvote you will receive.

### Which contributions are reviewed first?
>There is no set order, but moderators are encouraged to review older contributions first and we try to make sure contributions are reviewed within 72 hours.

### What do the icons and colours mean?
In general you can hover over the icons or colours to find out what they are, but if you can't then you can see what they mean below:

|Other|Category specific icon|
|Colour: RED|Not being reviewed / age isn't valid for upvote|
|Colour: GREEN|Being reviewed / age is valid|


### What is the bot's voting behaviour?
>Currently it waits until it reaches 99.75% voting power and then votes on the oldest contribution waiting in the upvote queue.

### How long does it take my contribution gets upvoted?
>Once it has been reviewed it is immediately added to the upvote queue. Once it is the oldest contribution left in the queue it is next in line to be upvoted.

### I can't find my contribution! Where is it?

>Using the correct tags is critical for our tools to fetch the contributions. Be sure that you used the tags correctly and that your contribution has not been upvoted yet. If the problem persists and no moderator has reviewed your contribution, then please use the #help channel on Discord.
