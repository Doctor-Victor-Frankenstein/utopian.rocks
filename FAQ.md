### I can't find my contribution! Where is it?

>Using the correct tags is critical for our tools to fetch the contributions. Be sure that you used the tags correctly and that your contribution has not been upvoted yet. If the problem persists and no moderator has reviewed your contribution, then please use the #help channel on Discord.
